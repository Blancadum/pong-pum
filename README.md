Pong Game
Hey there! Welcome to my version of the classic Pong game. If you enjoy challenges and want to test your reflexes, this game is for you.

What’s the Game About?
In this game, you face off against an opponent (it could be a bot!) and the goal is to get the ball past your rival. Move your paddle up and down to hit the ball and prevent it from slipping by. Every time you manage to hit the ball, you can feel like a champion!

But watch out, because every time the ball goes past your side, it counts as a lost life. The first player to lose all their lives loses the game, so keep your reflexes sharp.

Features:
Simple and Fun Graphics: A classic design that’ll give you a sense of nostalgia.
Music and Sound Effects: Each paddle hit has its own sound, making the experience more immersive.
Adjustable Difficulty: You can choose the speed of the game and the AI’s intelligence to challenge yourself more.
Try the Game!

If you have ideas or suggestions to improve the game, I’d love to hear them! This project is a work in progress and I’m always looking for ways to make it better.

Have Fun Playing!
So, what are you waiting for? Go ahead and play Pong! I hope you have as much fun playing it as I did creating it.
